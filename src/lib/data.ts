        Working on the optimization of transformer-based models (e.g.
            BERT) for text complexity classification in NLP. The initial work
            was part of the Research Project course in Innopolis University,
            which developed into a research internship. Currently working
            on the draft of a paper that presents the results of the
            experiments. Acquired practical experience with the Python
            ML libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch), and deeper
            theoretical understanding of ML models.
            Worked on a Systematic Literature Review on the Tradeoff
            between Fairness, Privacy, and Accuracy when using ML
            models (mainly GANs) in the context of the SLR course in
            Innopolis University.
